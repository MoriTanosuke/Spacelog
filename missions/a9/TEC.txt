00 03 07 27 CMP Okay. L_en we got off, we were iu pretty good
               shape and then for some reason _e noticed
              that we didn't have any LE_T t_anslation and
             tried to figure out why. Finally
            noticed
           that the primary quad C and secondary quad C
          isolation _alves were closed, aud the secondary
         Dog was closed,
        and by this
       ti_e
      we had z_ved
     over somewhat to the side.
    It took us a while
   to get back after we got that sorte_ out and
  probabAy used up quite a bit of gas getting um
 ,quared a_ay, but the docking was smooth. The
capture latches worked just right, there were
no oscillations after we captured. We lined it
up and did the retract, and it took about
10 seconds, and it sounded like ye got a good
solid lock.

         down and _bout h inches down from the top on

_es. The proble_ is that although we've got three
people in there, Ye can't have all three guys
working at the came time. And once you put your
suit on, you bec_me sort of useless. And every-
body has to eat, and we have to get the suits on,
we have to pod-erup the spacecraft, we probably
hmve to take them through a P52 or P51, and by
the time you get throu6h
doing A11 those things,
it Just takes
up 2 or 3 hours.
Roger. Understand. We're starting the rest period
tonight at 77:30-
right about that - which is an
hour and a half early.
_md as far as tomorrow
morning goes, do you agree with getting up an hour
and a half before the scheduled time? Is that
going to give you enough time?
I think maybe if we did some more _ork tonight,
we might be able to get up something like an hour
beforehand tomorrow. The trouble is we were up
pretty late last night trying to sort out all the
things. As you know, we transferred the checklist
be_k and forth, and flight plans back and forth;
it's really kind of a mess. I guess the thing
that we can plan on doing is gettirJgup something
like an hour ... checklist squared away, and then
we'll be ISA UP for tomorrow morning tonight.
I Just hope we can get it all done in an extra
hour. I tell you what, I have to look at tomorrow
morning's flight plan before I can tell you. I'll
let you know exactly what we are going to do.
03 03 16 26 CC Roger.
03 03 16 35 04P Houston, Gumdrop's still with you.
03 03 16 37 CC Okay, Gumdrop. Spider sort of faded out there.
              We agree with that. We're going to do everything
             we can to get you turned in as scon as possible
            tonight,
           and we agree to the hour in the morning
          for getting
         up earlier
        and guess we can discuss
       it more later, but we sure concur with all those.

I have sort of a cl_mux or summary of what we did
today. I think that the procedure that we have
worked out for the EVA transfer from oue spacecraf%
to another is no problem whatsoever. The procedures
are good, and I think we can plan on using them
henceforth
if they are needed,
Roger, Apollo 9. We copy and agree with that.
Frc_ monitor£_g in your conversation, it did
sound like they were real good. It sounded like
the getting in and out of the hatch was quite
easy, and I heard Rusty's comments on the hand-
rail. Sounded like they _ere pretty g_o_.
